### FAQ

**Is this really necessary?** Nope. Just a project to familiarize myself with React Native.

**Do I need this?** Probably not.

**Why use Random.org?** It's easier than trying to implement complex crypto algorithms, and it does what I need. 

**Shouldn't you be concealing the API key?** Yep, if this was a real App on the market the API key would need to be fetched from a database. It's not a published app, so I've decided for the sake of simplicity to import from a constant.
